<h3 align="center">Light Employee Manager</h3>

  <p align="center">
   Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Light Employee Manger is a command-line application that manages a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
